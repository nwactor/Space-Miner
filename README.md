# Space-Miner
Space Miner is a 3D game in which the player pilots a space ship through a field of asteroids, collecting free-floating chunks of gold and writhing clusters of plasma. The game ends when the player either crashes into an asteroid, or collects enough treasure to win.

The game features an asteroid field that is randomly generated each time, original 3D models, and is powered by the three.js library. This version is a prototype, and is missing features like a visible score counter, game-over notifications, and a menu screen.
